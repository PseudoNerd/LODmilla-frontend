LODmilla - a graph-based Linked Open Data browser

http://lcpd2013.research-infrastructures.eu/slides/lodmilla.pdf

Intended as a prototype tool for generic LOD browsing. 
This frontend of LODmilla is written in "plain" jQuery, no js frameworks used (yet).
Graph visualization is done by jsPlumb.

We are searching contributors for writing plug-ins or improve the code.
