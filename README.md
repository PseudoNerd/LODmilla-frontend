LODmilla-frontend
=================

LODmilla - a graph-based Linked Open Data browser

Intended as a prototype tool for LOD browsing, with some useful functions implemented. It is a part of a bigger project, as a proof-of-concept, don't expect production quality :)

This frontend of LODmilla is written in "plain" jQuery, no js frameworks used (yet).

Graph visualization is done by jsPlumb.

LODmilla is working fine, with some small bugs and UX fails, needs refactoring (possibly rewriting in a proper framework, eg. AngularJS), as it started to become spaghetti :)

Any contribs are welcome, and feel free to play with it.
